# About
This project is developed in the course of a Masterthesis. 
The Project is not Published here yet due to Legal issues which still needs to be consulted with my Mastertheisis Mentor.
I am looking forward working on a Docker Prototype, which contains the Basic BLE Scanning und BLE GATT features and publish it mid/end July.

If there is any interest to contact me feel free to write an Issue or Contact me on.
